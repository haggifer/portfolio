Hi, my name is Michael Katskiy, I'm a web-developer.

Here you can find projects that I prepared for presenting my skills in web development. Due to business policy of companies I've worked for I can't share commercial projects I did for them, so these are my only option to present my skills to you. 

If you have any questions about any of projects presented here - feel free to contact me with email (katmiale@gmail.com), with LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/michael-katskiy-b385401a0), or by any other way convenient for you.
