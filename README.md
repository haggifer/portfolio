On this page you will find projects I prepared for presenting my skills in web development. Due to the business policy of companies I've worked for, I can't share commercial projects I did for them, so it's my only way to present my skills.

If you have any questions about any of the projects presented here - feel free to contact me by email (katmiale@gmail.com), with LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/michael-katskiy-b385401a0), or by any other way convenient for you.
